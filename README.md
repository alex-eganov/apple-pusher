# apple-pusher

A simple library for creating and sending push-notifications to apple devices via APNs.
Supports sending over http/2 protocol preferred by Apple and both of authentication types: token-based and via ssl-cert.

### Can I use it for production?
Not yet, dude. Now I am actively testing library functional in my projects, supplementing it with tests. 
When I feel like the library is ready, version 1.0.0 will be released. 

### Installation
```composer require bibi4k0/apple-pusher```

### Documentation

See ```example/cmd.php``` for usecases.
